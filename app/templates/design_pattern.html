                <p>Design patterns are used to represent the pattern used by developers to create software or web
          application. These patterns are selected based on the requirement analysis. The patterns describe
          the solution to the problem, when and where to apply the solution and the consequences of the
          implementation.</p>
        <p>Python is an open source scripting language. It has libraries that support a variety of design
          patterns. The syntax of python is easy to understand and uses English keywords.
          Python provides support for the list of design patterns some of them are as mentioned below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Singleton pattern</li>
          <li>Factory pattern</li>
          <li>Builder pattern</li>
          <li>Facade pattern</li>
          <li>Command pattern</li>
          <li>Prototype pattern</li>
          <li>Proxy pattern</li>
          <li>Chain of Responsibility pattern</li>
          <li>Abstract Factory pattern</li>
          <li>Observer Pattern</li>

                <h2 class="adjust-margin"> <strong><b> Factory pattern</b></strong></h2>
                <p>The factory pattern comes under the creational patterns list category. It provides one of the
                    best ways to create an object. In factory pattern, objects are created without exposing the logic
                    to client and referring to the newly created object using a common interface.</p>

                <p>Factory patterns are implemented in Python using factory method. When a user calls a method such
                    that we pass in a string and the return value as a new object is implemented through factory
                    method. The type of object used in factory method is determined by string which is passed through
                    method.</p>
                <p>In our calculator program, a <strong> factory method </strong>is utilized in the calculation.py file
                    within the calculation's directory as the <strong>"create"</strong> method that allows for a
                    calculation object (Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication) to be made with argument values.

                    <h3 class="adjust-margin"><strong><b> Command Pattern </b></strong></h3>
                    <p>Command Pattern adds a level of abstraction between actions and includes an object, which
                        invokes these actions.</p>
                    <p>In this design pattern, client creates a command object that includes a list of commands to be
                        executed. The command object created implements a specific interface.</p>
                    <p>Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that
                        contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a
                        method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.</p>
                    <p>In our calculator program, a <strong> command pattern </strong>is utilized in the calculator.py file
                        within the calculator directory. Basically in Calculator class, we are not defining any method. We are just
                        calling the methods which are created in other classes.
